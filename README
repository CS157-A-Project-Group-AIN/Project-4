DataBase Initialization:

1.Run SQLBuild script inside ./src/Utils/SQLBuild

2.Since our requirements don't require us to implement full patient
functionality you will need to run a seed script that
adds initial patient data. this script is located in ./src/Utils/Seed
!!!Make Sure this is run in a terminal that won't close on completion!!!
!!!You will need to gather the outputted details for later use!!!
!!!These details include patient data to use for the Visit Screen!!!



Running Front end Program:

Run the ETRTDriver located in ./src/etrt/ETRTDriver
